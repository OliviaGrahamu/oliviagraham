<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>In my five-year degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo, I found opportunities to participate in many extra-curricular activities and complete projects in lab settings. In first year, Quantum Valley Investments chose my partner and me as two-time finalists in the Problem Pitch competition for our research into limitations in the expansion of lab-on-a-chip technology. In fourth year, my capstone project team successfully created a microfluidic contact lens to collect tear fluid samples in order to promote more comfortable and less contaminated collection. Above all, I love exploring my passions and continuing to learn.</p>
